- unique
    - by day
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT mac)
		FROM test_timestamp
		WHERE DATE(first_seen)=DATE(‘${date}’)
            - date is determined by the lambda
            - date should be in format ‘yyyy-mm-dd’
            - Change to SELECT * to get the whole table on a specific day
    - by week
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT mac)
		FROM test_timestamp
		WHERE extract(week FROM first_seen)=extract(week FROM DATE('2020-1-14'))
    - by month
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT mac)
		FROM test_timestamp
		WHERE extract(month FROM first_seen)=extract(month FROM DATE('2020-1-14'))
- repeat
    - by day
		SELECT mac, COUNT(*) visits 
		FROM test_timestamp
		WHERE DATE(first_seen)=DATE('2019-12-12')
		GROUP BY mac
		HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
		ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
        - This lists all of the mac address with repeat instances and the number of repeat instances
    - by week
		SELECT mac, COUNT(*) visits 
		FROM test_timestamp
		WHERE extract(week FROM first_seen)=extract(week FROM DATE('2020-1-14'))
		GROUP BY mac
		HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
		ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    - by month
		SELECT mac, COUNT(*) visits 
		FROM test_timestamp
		WHERE extract(month FROM first_seen)=extract(month FROM DATE('2020-1-14'))
		GROUP BY mac
		HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
		ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
- total people in store per hour
		SELECT date_trunc('hour', first_seen) time, Count(*) visits
		FROM test_timestamp
		GROUP BY date_trunc('hour', first_seen)
		ORDER BY date_trunc('hour', first_seen)
- duration of visit
    select mac, date_diff('minute', first_seen, last_seen) minutes
    from test_timestamp
    order by date_diff('minute', first_seen, last_seen) desc
